I made this project based on my interest in text-based/point and click adventure games growing up.  

This project was based on the Sierra game: Quest For Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero.

I was fascinated with this game growing up, but would mainly watch my brother and mom play.  I wanted to create a 1980s computer game aestetic and pay homiage to Sierra Entertainment.
